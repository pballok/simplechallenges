Conway's Game of Life:

The unvierse is a grid of square cells that could have two states: dead or alive.
Every cell interacts with its adjacent neighbors, with the following transactions occuring every step:
- Under-population: Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies
- Live on: Any live cell with two or three neighbors lives on
- Overpopulation: Any live cell with more than three neighbors dies
- Reproduction: Any dead cell with exactly three neighbors becomes a live cell
